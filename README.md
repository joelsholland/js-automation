# js-automation

Simple web pages with javascript that automate boring tasks.  
I first made PowerShell scripts for these tasks, but then decided it would be nice to have some sort of GUI.

### Contents
- [**FetchXML Generator**](https://joelsholland.github.io/js-automation/fetchxml/Fetchxml-generator.htm)
  - Helps to create Fetch XML filters for querying data in Dataverse (Dynamics 365). I use it alongside Jonas Rapp's **Fetch XML Builder** tool when I need to filter on a list of accountids, contactids or similar.
- [**Power Automate expressions**](https://joelsholland.github.io/js-automation/power-automate/power-automate-expression.html)
  - Creates expressions to use in Power Automate when you need to process the JSON that you retrieved from a data source.
